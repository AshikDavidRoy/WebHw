          2 semesters and will be evaluated in the 7th and 8th semester separately, based on the achieved
          objectives. One third of the project credits shall be completed in 7th semester and two third in 8th
          semester. It is recommended that the projects may be finalized in the thrust areas of the respective
          engineering stream or as interdisciplinary projects. Importance should be given to address societal
          problems and developing indigenous technologies.
          <br><br>Course Objectives <br>
          <ul>
            <li>To apply engineering knowledge in practical problem solving.</li>
            <li>To foster innovation in design of products, processes or systems.</li>
            <li>To develop creative thinking in finding viable solutions to engineering problems.</li>

        <p class="w3-text-grey">Evaluation by the Guide
          <br><br>
          The guide/supervisor shall monitor the progress being carried out by the project groups on a
          regular basis. In case it is found that progress is unsatisfactory it shall be reported to the
          Department Evaluation Committee for necessary action. The presence of each student in the group
          and their involvement in all stages of execution of the project shall be ensured by the guide.
          Project evaluation by the guide: 30 Marks. This mark shall be awarded to the students in his/her
          group by considering the following aspects:
        <ul style="color: gray;">
          <li>Topic Selection: innovativeness, social relevance etc. (2)</li>
          <li>Problem definition: Identification of the social, environmental and ethical issues of the project
            problem. (2)</li>
          <li>Purpose and need of the project: Detailed and extensive explanation of the purpose and need of
            the project. (3)</li>
          <li>Project Objectives: All objectives of the proposed work are well defined; Steps to be followed to
            solve the defined problem are clearly specified. (2)
          </li>
          <li> Project Scheduling & Distribution of Work among Team members: Detailed and extensive
            Scheduling with timelines provided for each phase of project. Work breakdown structure well
            defined. (3)
          </li>
          <li> Literature survey: Outstanding investigation in all aspects. (4)
          </li>
          <li>Student’s Diary/ Daily Log: The main purpose of writing daily diary is to cultivate the habit of
            documenting and to encourage the students to search for details. It develops the students’ thought
            process and reasoning abilities. The students should record in the daily/weekly activity diary the
            day to day account of the observations, impressions, information gathered and suggestions given,
            if any. It should contain the sketches & drawings related to the observations made by the students.
            The daily/weekly activity diary shall be signed after every day/week by the guide. (7)
          </li>
          <li>Individual Contribution: The contribution of each student at various stages. (7) </li>

          Preamble: This course aims to offer students hands-on experience on compiler design
          concepts. Students will be able to familiarize with tools such as LEX and YACC and
          automate different phases of a compiler. This course helps the learners to enhance the
          capability to design and implement a compiler.
